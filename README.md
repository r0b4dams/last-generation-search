# Narrative Futures

## Developing an Inter- and Transdisciplinary Approach to Constructing Futures and Shaping Transformation through Narratives

An unanswered question in the study of sustainability-oriented transformation processes is how specific visions of the future are narratively constructed and to what extent processes of future storytelling influence concrete actions toward societal transformation.

The project team will address this question from a new perspective: Given the fundamental uncertainty of the future, the central challenge lies in understanding how future-oriented transformation pathways are constructed through narratives and narrative processes, and how they need to be designed to enable collective action. This perspective aims to contribute to transformation research while simultaneously creating a foundation that enables practitioners to reflect on their narrative strategies.

The team examines narratives within the climate movement and the field of urban transformation, employing a mixed-methods approach that combines innovative techniques such as quantitative and computer-assisted text mining, qualitative narrative analysis, and transdisciplinary methods of knowledge integration. By doing so, the team seeks to achieve innovative theoretical insights for transformation research, practical implications for societal actors, and new methods for action-oriented transdisciplinary research in real-worldÂ laboratories.
